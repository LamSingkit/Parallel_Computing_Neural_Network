# Parallelizing Neural Network using MPI
The goal of this project is to implement a neural network using parallel computing
technique Message Passing Interface (MPI). A basic sequential neural network was
coded in Python including one hidden layer and one output layer, and then parallelized
by using data parallelism with the help of MPI for python (mpi4py). The improvement
in performance with different number of processors has been evaluated and compared.
The results showed that parallel computing could significantly speed up the training
process.
